# I'm Sorry, Dave

A short prototype for a 2D top-down space survival and puzzle game. It takes inspiration from HAL in *2001: A Space Odyssey* and pits you against an AI that really does not want to relinquish control of the ship.

## Game Concept
Explore the vessel and nearby space while fighting a malfunctioning computer. Your aim is to override the ship's systems and bring them back online before the AI finds a way to eject you into the vacuum.

## Core Loop
Navigate between ship interiors and the zero-G exterior, reclaim control from HAL and survive its sabotage attempts.

## Objectives
- Reboot life support
- Disable HAL's surveillance cameras
- Avoid being ejected into space
- Solve logic puzzles the AI throws at you
- Rewire ship systems under time pressure

## Twist
HAL adapts. Each time you succeed, the AI becomes smarter. The game ends when you achieve a full manual overrideâ€¦ or when HAL finally manages to space you.

## Mechanics
- EVA movement with inertia
- Limited oxygen supply
- Real-time hacking mini-games
- Voice cues from HAL ("I can't let you do that, Dave") trigger hazards

## Controls
- Arrow keys or **WASD** to move

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the game with `python main.py`.
   - The game automatically falls back to SDL's dummy video and audio drivers if no display or sound hardware is available (e.g. on a server).
