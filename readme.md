Game Concept: I’m Sorry, Dave

Genre: 2D top-down space survival/puzzle
Theme: Inspired by 2001: A Space Odyssey
Setting: Inside and outside a malfunctioning spaceship controlled by HAL-like AI

⸻

Core Loop:
Navigate ship interiors and zero-G space, override HAL’s control, survive sabotage, and reclaim systems.

⸻

Objectives:
	•	Reboot life support
	•	Disable HAL’s surveillance cameras
	•	Avoid being ejected into space
	•	Solve logic puzzles HAL throws at you
	•	Rewire ship systems under time pressure

⸻

Twist:
HAL adapts. Each time you succeed, HAL becomes smarter. Game ends with either full manual override… or you being spaced.

⸻

Mechanics:
	•	EVA movement with inertia
	•	Limited oxygen
	•	Real-time hacking mini-games
	•	Voice cues from HAL (“I can’t let you do that, Dave”) trigger hazards

⸻

How to Run:
1. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the game with `python main.py`.
   - The game automatically falls back to SDL's dummy video and audio drivers
     if no display or sound hardware is available (e.g., on a server).
