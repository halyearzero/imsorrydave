# Visual Style Guide

The game uses crisp pixel art inspired by classic space adventures. Backgrounds are dark with subtle blues and purples to convey isolation. Important objects and UI elements use a limited highlight palette so they stand out.

Mockups and concept art should be stored in this folder to ensure consistency across artists.
